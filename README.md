# MidJourney-Wrapper

This project has been ported from the Python language to the Golang language and further improved. The original project can be found at: https://github.com/Wildric-Auric/MidJourney-Wrapper

## Presentation
The point of this bot is using [MidJouney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/) from an account other than the account you paid from.
To do so, there should be a Discord bot, which we will call DaVinci (see [Globals](https://github.com/Wildric-Auric/MidJourney-Wrapper/blob/main/Globals.py)), and the account subscribed to MidJourney, which we will call Salai, in the same server. Any discord user in the server can use DaVinci commands to generate images, their variations, upscale them...<br>
Warning though; you aren't allowed to use this software in the purpose of sharing your subscription with other people; this software is intended to be used only for learning purposes. If you infringe the rules, please know that you are solely responsible.
